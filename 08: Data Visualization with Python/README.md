# Data Visualization with Python✨

Data visualization is a crucial part of data analysis, as it allows us to better understand and communicate patterns, trends, and insights in our data and 
to communicate data or information clearly and effectively to readers and its one of the important stages of data analysis.Typically, data is visualized in the form of a chart, infographic, diagram or map.

## 📄 Summary

This course teaches how to present and visualize complex data in a manner that makes sense to people, and allows for insights to be easily seen and derived.
This course makes use of several Python data visualization libraries such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, and Folium, to explore Canadian immigration data. 
It also covers dashboard creation using Plotly Dash, with a final assignment combining the skills learned to analyse and report US domestic airline flights performance. in a dashboard.
